# Meeting Notes – 19 Nov 2024

**Attendees:** Yash Lunawat, Deepanshu Mehta, Rishabh Gusain  
**Duration:** 60 minutes (async follow-up on Slack)

## Agenda
1. Lock data sources (World Bank indicators + OpenAQ snapshot).
2. Finalise analytical questions / hypotheses linked to rubric.
3. Assign responsibilities for ETL, modelling, and documentation.
4. Define success metrics and verification steps.

## Decisions & Highlights
- Adopted `python3 -m src.data.collect` + `python3 -m src.data.preprocess` as canonical pipeline commands; missing data handled with intra-country ffill/bfill.
- Confirmed OpenAQ Kaggle snapshot as the legally shareable source (since official API v3 requires keys).
- Agreed on Random Forest baseline for predictive work plus Plotly for interactive dashboards (choropleth slider + GDP vs PM2.5 bubbles).
- Documented analysis philosophy (holistic + transparent) for inclusion in `results/reports/analysis_report.md`.

## Action Items
| Owner | Task | Due |
|-------|------|-----|
| **Yash** | Maintain repo scaffolding, update README with quickstart + data provenance | 20 Nov |
| **Deepanshu** | Implement `collect.py`, `preprocess.py`, add smoketests, run pipeline | 21 Nov |
| **Rishabh** | Summarise literature findings, lead visual storytelling + methodology doc | 22 Nov |

## Evidence for Consistency
- Commits associated with this meeting: `collect.py`, `preprocess.py`, `analysis/analyze.py`, `docs/methodology.md`.
- Test run (`python3 -m pytest`) captured in terminal log and referenced in final report.
